Preamble
--------

For Questions 9 - 15, let
![X \\sim B(n, p)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Csim%20B%28n%2C%20p%29 "X \sim B(n, p)")
with ![n = 8](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%20%3D%208 "n = 8")
and
![p = 0.2](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20%3D%200.2 "p = 0.2").

For this section, please use this file for help with the R code. We
highly encourage you to look up the documentation on your own time.

Look at the `rbinom()` documentation to sample draws from this binomial
distribution. Use it to generate a vector called “successes” with 1000
draws from this distribution.
