For Questions 9 - 15, let

![ X \\sim B(n, p) ](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%20X%20%5Csim%20B%28n%2C%20p%29%20 " X \sim B(n, p) ")

with $ n = 8 $ and $ p = 0.2 $.

For this section, please use this file for help with the R code. We
highly encourage you to look up the documentation on your own time.

Look at the `rbinom()` documentation to sample draws from this binomial
distribution. Use it to generate a vector called “successes” with 1000
draws from this distribution.
