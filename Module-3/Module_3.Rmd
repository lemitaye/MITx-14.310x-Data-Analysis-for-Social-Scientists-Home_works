## Preamble

For Questions 9 - 15, let $ X \sim B(n, p) $ with $ n = 8 $ and $ p = 0.2 $.

For this section, please use this file for help with the R code. We highly encourage you to look up the documentation on your own time.

Look at the `rbinom()` documentation to sample draws from this binomial distribution. Use it to generate a vector called "successes" with 1000 draws from this distribution.
