## Queston 12

Suppose that you want R to display ''Hello world!'' Drag and drop the phrases to create the correct R input. Note that there may be multiple ways to write this in R but we want you to use this command specifically.

### Answer
```{r Q_12}
print("Hello World!")
```

## Question 13

If you run the following code in R, what does the object my_sqrt contain?

```{r eval=FALSE}
z <- c(pi, 205, 149, -2)
y <- c(z, 555, z)
y <- 2 * y + 760
my_sqrt <- sqrt(y - 1)
```

### Answer

Let's run the code and observe the output.

```{r Q_13}
z <- c(pi, 205, 149, -2)
y <- c(z, 555, z)
y <- 2 * y + 760
my_sqrt <- sqrt(y - 1)

my_sqrt
```

It appears our output is a vector of length 9.
